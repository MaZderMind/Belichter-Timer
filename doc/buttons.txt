I have nice tactile 90° noard-mounted switches from omron here (Omron B3F-3100) that actually bounce
very little. I needed a whole bunch of tried to get the bouncing on the scope; you can see it in
bounce.png. The yellow waveform is measured right at the switch; the blue comes from the PCINT pin
change interrupt. In this graphic we can also nicely see the time delay the avr takes to react to pin.
The scope measured 11.3 µs in this specific case.

We see a bounce after ~40 µs for ~20µs. In the software we have our display timer running at 3.125kHz,
so its interrupt is firing every 320µs. So a single (complete) tick of our display timer would be enough
to get rid of any bouncing.

So what we'll do is setup a sub-routine called from our display timer. On Button-Press we'll set a counter
to 3. On button release we'll set the counter to 0. On each tick of our display timer we'll check if the
counter is >0. If it is, decremrnt it by 1. If the value after the decrement is == 0, execute the desired
button-action. This way we supress button-bouncing at both, the falling and the rising edge in a timespan
of min. 640 µs. This should give us plenty margin with additional bouncing over time.

If still problems with bouncing occur, the number of debounce cycles (DEBOUNCE_HI) can be upped to really
high values like 250 without loosing the feeling of the device reacting instantaneously.
