The LED Module was refurbished from an old SAT Receiver. It is a small breakout board consisting of
four LA4022-11 (http://pdf.datasheetarchive.com/datasheetsmain/Datasheets-27/DSA-530151.pdf) wired
in parallel (all equal anodes and cathodes are wired together).

The Anodes and Cathodes are bond out to two binheaders of 7 and 4 pins. Those pins are connected as
described in the following diagram. The actual footprint and an adequate schema symbol can be found
in the led-display.lbr library alongisde this project.
