The LED Module was refurbished from an old SAT Receiver. It is a small breakout board consisting of
four LA4022-11 (http://pdf.datasheetarchive.com/datasheetsmain/Datasheets-27/DSA-530151.pdf) wired
in parallel (all equal anodes and cathodes are wired together).

The Anodes and Cathodes are bond out to two binheaders of 7 and 4 pins. Those pins are connected as
described in the following diagram. The actual footprint and an adequate schema symbol can be found
in the led-display.lbr library alongisde this project.

  0  1  2  3  4  5  6                    A  B  C  D

0 = Cathode B
1 = Cathode F
2 = Cathode A
3 = Cathode G
4 = Anode Digit 1
5 = Anode Digit 2
6 = Cathode C


A = Anode Digit 3
B = Anode Digit 4
C = Cathode D
D = Cathode E

DP is present but not available as Pin on this package.



On the softwate-Side the display is driven by a Timer which is configured to oscilate at 3.125kHz. It is shown
as blue waveform in display.png. The timer drives 4*7 Segements, which gives a display update frequency of
3125รท7รท4 = 111.6 Hz. So each single Segment blinks at a rate of >100Hz which gives an absolute flicker-free
display. The yellow waveform in display.png shows Cathode B while displaying "done". In this mode only one Digit
has an enabled Cathode B, which is why we can senst the Update-Rate of the display nicely. One can see it repeating
at exactly the calculated 111.6 Hz with a duty-cycle of 1/7/4 = 3.5% (the scope measured 3.125% due to the time
needed by the chip to to the swiching and the math).

At a duty cycle of only ~3% we need no series resistance to save the led from dying. I did not measure the current
draw (should do); if someone has a formular at hand, please file an issue.
